As I am not working I have all the time in the world. I very recently discovered MCP (Model Context Protocol). I cancelled my Copilot subscription and signed up for Cursor PRO it's Â£20 but it's definitely worth it. I added the Supabase MCP and the Github MCP to my Cursor IDE and have just gone advanced further into the future! .... WOW THIS IS AMAZING!!!

With the MCP's added to Cursor, I instructed my AI agent to create a to application using my supabase account and it only went away and created a new table in Supabase and a React application, I delved deeper and created authentication, I have a login and registration page, it took 2 minutes to create and test, Ooooh myyyy goooood I'm completely blown away, so, AI can do mmy job with my instruction. So i had a think for about 5 minutes.

I then instructed the AI agent to create a products table with a form in the app so I can add new products. I also asked it to utilize the storage within supabase for my product images. It only went away and did it for me quite easily, I then asked for Edit and Delete functionality. Wow, I'm about 10 minutes in and I nearly have a fully functional app with authentication. Usually something like this would take at least a week to build. I am so excited to see what I can build in the morning, I'm such a geek but it excites me!
