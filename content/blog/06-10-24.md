Today is the last day in Malaga. it's been such a great time with Martin and the boys most of us have just relaxed by the pool in the shade. I took a walk up the beach with Charles, we came, we saw, we conquered!

Plane back to Stanstead and said my goodbyes to the lads. Maybe we will meet again and have a night out in London soon, I think thet are up for that?!

Oh... the green cocks you ask... that was part of the fun within the WhatsApp group, were everyone had a cock drawn on them... more or less
