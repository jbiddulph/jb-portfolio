Hazy Jane gives me a headache!

It's been a while and I'm getting on, I'm 46 next month, I really need to spend some time to get on with documenting parts of my life, it might be nice for Albert to read! I think I'm going to talk a lot about Albert...

ok so.... he is amazing, I love him so much. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me, he changed my life!.... And I could not have done it without Jess, who is also amazing but in a different way.

A lot of the time lately, I think, Life is crap. We do the same thing every day, it was good that I went away for Martin's 50th in Malaga last week.
