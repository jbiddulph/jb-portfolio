It was so difficult to pick where to stay... This time I chose teh Mercure at Haymarket, near Fountainbridge, maybe it's too far?! hmm oh well, it was Â£102 and looks semi decent.

3pm and I jump on the train at West Worthing, bumped into James, he said to buy a ticket on my phone from Three Bridges, what a good idea. So I did that lol. Got to Gatwick and pondered about the north terminal, had a coffee and a wee and another coffee and a wee.

Delays, stood in a bus next to the plane waiting for the engineers to fix a leaky toilet then waited on the plan for a furtehr 30 minutes for Air Traffic Control Edinburgh to slot us in a designated estimated landing time slot... oh god!

So I got to Edinburgh and jumped on a bus for 20 minutes to go and meet Tom for a couple of beers at the Brass Monkey, Still got my heavy bag with my laptop in, no time to check in at the hotel. Met Tom and had 3 and a half pints, we chatted about vans, Germany, England, accents, moustaches and what women really want.

I got in a taxi (barely remember the conversation with the driver) something about a busy touristy beach holiday destination sri lanka? or Canary Islands, I can't remember just that he said there are lots of topless Scandinavian girls there.

I checked in requesting more water, water is essential, especially in the night, I don't care how many times I go to the loo. The view from my window was of teh room oppossite, great, their curtains were closed!
