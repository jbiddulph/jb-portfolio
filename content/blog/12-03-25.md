I've sold teh yellow VW Notch to a VW fanatic in Illinois. Man is on his way to collect it from my garage and take to Southampton depot, this was a slightly sad morning. Meanwhile back at work in my office at home. The new PM getting funny with me again about deadlines (which ahd beeen met) and why the bit I was working on not completed by last friday.... cut long story short... Si called me and I was dismissed (unfairly, so I appealed and got my garden leave). I must have applied a for about 50 jobs that afternoon!
