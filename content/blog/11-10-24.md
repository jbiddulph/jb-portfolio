Today was a normal workday. I'm currently designing a new project in Figma which is proving to be quite difficult. 
after talking to the lady on the plane on Sunday evening, I started watching monsters on Netflix a few days ago. Looking forward to season two episode four tonight on the projector wearing my Bluetooth headphones. Its actually getting quite good!
