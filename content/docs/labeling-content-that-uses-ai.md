# Labeling Content That Uses Artificial Intelligence

When content includes material generated or assisted by Artificial Intelligence (AI), a brief, clear disclosure helps set expectations for readers and supports transparency. This short guide explains when to disclose AI use, how to phrase it, and practical best practices.

## When to Disclose

Disclose AI involvement when any of the following apply:

- Substantial portions of text, images, audio, or code were generated by an AI tool.
- AI contributed to the structure, phrasing, analysis, or creative elements of the content.
- Legal, ethical, or organizational policies require transparency about AI-assisted outputs.

If AI only provided minor suggestions (e.g., grammar fixes or minor phrasing), a disclosure is still recommended when in doubt.

## How to State It

Keep the disclosure concise, explicit, and easy to find. Use plain language and place the note near the content (e.g., at the top, in a footer, or alongside the relevant section).

Example phrasing options:

- "This content includes material generated with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence."
- "AI-Assisted: Portions of this article were drafted with the help of an AI tool and reviewed by a human."
- "Generated in part by an AI model; human edits applied."

## Examples

Inline or short footers:

- Inline: This article includes AI-assisted text.
- Footer: Disclosure — AI-assisted content.

Longer disclosure (when you want more detail):

- "This article contains sections generated by an AI model (tool name optional). All outputs were reviewed and edited by the author for accuracy and clarity."

## Best Practices

- Be specific when useful: indicate which sections or assets were AI-generated.
- Name the tool or model if required by policy or if it improves transparency.
- Ensure human review: verify factual accuracy, tone, and safety before publishing.
- Keep disclosures consistent across platforms and content types.
- Provide a short link or reference to an explanation of how the AI was used, if readers might need more context.

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Disclosure present and visible
- [ ] Plain-language wording used
- [ ] Human review completed
- [ ] Tool/model noted (optional, per policy)
- [ ] Additional context provided if needed

Being upfront about AI involvement builds trust and helps readers evaluate content appropriately. Small, consistent disclosures are an easy step toward clearer communication.
